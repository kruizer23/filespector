    <p>
      FileSpector is a GUI tool for quickly finding all text occurrences in multiple files in a directory, matching a specific file extension pattern. It is developed for GNU/Linux systems. Its focus is on simplicity and ease-of-use, as opposed to feature-rich.

    <p>
      Double-clicking a line in the search results, opens the file in the text editor at the line containing the search term. FileSpector automatically detects the text editor installed on your GNU/Linux system.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wide range of command-line options are supported, making it possible to integrate FileSpector with existing tools. You could for example add a &quot;Find in Files&quot; option to your file manager&apos;s pop-up menu, after right-clicking a directory.
